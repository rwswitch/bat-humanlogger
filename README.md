Really bad template generating script. MS Batch file edition

Sometimes call volume wouldn't allow for ticket entry in a timely manner, so I cobbled together this script to allow for faster data recording. When call volume dies down or during breaks in work, I would enter the information into the system. 

In this case, I had limited resources available. No access to other scripting languages or better editors. The poor little i3 I was working on could barely handle Outlook, a browser, and VoIP software. So I shaved out the browser component by keeping text file reference docs and this note-taking script.

All it does is copy a template to a new, timestamped file, then opens your editor with that file.
